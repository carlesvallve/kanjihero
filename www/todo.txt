// Features
// ------------------------------------

- autoexplore: 
	- First button on left hot-slots should be 'autoexplore'.
	- when clicking it, we should choose an optimal tile to go to:
		- nearest nice visible item
		- nearest unexplored tile
	- when we arrive to the selected tile, repeat the process until we see a monster or change level

- stats:
	- generate stats data files for:
		- hero
		- monsters
		- items
		- weapons
		- equipment

- inventory:
	- drop items
	- equipment double configuration:
		- when equiping a weapon in equipment weaponR, equip it in hotSlots weaponR too ---------> OK!
		- when equiping a weapon in equipment weaponL, equip it in hotSlots weaponL too ---------> OK!

-combat:
	- ranged attacks:
		- we should be able to perform ranged attacks if we have a ranged weapon equipped -------> OK!

- monster ai:
	- monsters have to update their fov each time we/they move, but not render it, so they know whats going on
	- monsters should move at his own speed rate when we move
	- not sure if we should use A* or use a simplier follow/escape algorithm

- monster dialogs:
	monsters will occasionally say things to you, sentences chosen at random from a sentences list

- dungeon generators:
	- parameters with a bit of controlled random to generate more variable dungeons
	- implement cave generation algorithm
	- create other lights that alter lightIntensity in other areas than the player
	- implement room elements in certain rooms ---------------------------------------------------------------> OK!
	- implement wall decorations -----------------------------------------------------------------------------> OK!
	- find perfect algorithm for wall directions:
		- walls should be propperly named
		- imgType co-relation of walls and doors
		- wall ends (only one wall as neighbour) should calculate ending direction and apply correct graphic
		- wall that is 3wall type, has to be single if all other walls are in the same direction
	- floors
		- find nice graphical co-relation with walls
		- there are too few nice floor tiles, and too much not-usable 
		- find more suitable tiles and generate new tileset
		- there is a weird line in between floor tiles, probably because of the canvas antialiasing -> fix it

// Bugs
// ------------------------------------


- weird tiles on furniture and walldeco:
	- rethink what we do with files on walldeco/png_problematic

- wall directions: 4 wall tile doesnt work (?) looks like w-e... -> OK!

- hero doesnt remember selectedWeapon when he change dungeon level...

- inventory layout is only good for 480px screens,
  we must make it more responsive to diferent resolutions
